# DHI-clone
DHI was an app which my college used in my first year engineering . I was always curious to make like that of my own . Now I was studying Django, I thought of giving a shot.
In this application, people can noramlly signup and by default they will be logged in as student , if one needs to upgrade status to teacher it can done by openina a private link,
here I've kept '/upgrade' which can be changed later

Teacher can create class inside the app, and students to join, Once students have joined teachers gets to mark attendwnce and even edit pervious attendence details, and see attendence report of all the students at once which shows how much percentage of attendence they have.
Teachers can also Enter/Edit marks , for the student View, they get the option to join class or see theie marks report , where it summarises their marks obtained in all the registered course.

Software Used:
Django 3.2
