# DHI-clone
DHI was an app which my college used in my first year engineering . I was always curious to make like that of my own . Now I was studying Django, I thought of giving a shot.
In this application, people can normally signup and by default they will be logged in as student , if one needs to upgrade status to teacher it can done by opening a private link,
here I've kept '/upgrade' which can be changed later

Teacher can create class inside the app, and students to join, Once students have joined teachers gets to mark attendance and even edit pervious attendance details, and see attendance report of all the students at once which shows how much percentage of attendance they have.
Teachers can also Enter/Edit marks , for the student View, they get the option to join class or see their marks report , where it summarize their marks obtained in all the registered course.

Software Used:
Django 3.2
